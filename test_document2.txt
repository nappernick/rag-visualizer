Advanced RAG Systems Documentation

This document describes advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and their components.

Vector Databases:
- Pinecone provides managed vector search with automatic scaling
- Weaviate offers open-source vector search with GraphQL API
- Qdrant delivers high-performance vector similarity search
- Milvus supports billion-scale vector data management

Language Models:
- GPT-4 from OpenAI offers advanced reasoning capabilities
- Claude from Anthropic provides safe and helpful AI assistance
- PaLM from Google enables multilingual understanding
- LLaMA from Meta provides open-source foundation models

RAG Pipeline Components:
- Document loaders extract text from various formats
- Text splitters chunk documents into manageable pieces
- Embedding models convert text to vector representations
- Retrievers find relevant context from vector stores
- Generators produce answers using retrieved context

Integration Frameworks:
- LangChain orchestrates LLM applications
- LlamaIndex manages document indexing and retrieval
- Haystack provides end-to-end NLP pipelines
- Semantic Kernel from Microsoft enables AI orchestration

These components work together to create powerful RAG applications that combine the benefits of retrieval-based and generative AI approaches.
