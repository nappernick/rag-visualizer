RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful technique that combines vector databases like Qdrant and Pinecone with large language models such as GPT-4 and Claude. The system uses embeddings generated by models like text-embedding-3-small from OpenAI. Frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex help orchestrate the retrieval pipeline. The chunking strategy is critical for performance, with techniques like hierarchical chunking improving retrieval accuracy. Neo4j can be used for knowledge graphs while PostgreSQL stores metadata.
