# RAG Visualizer - Chunking & Graph Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

After testing the RAG visualizer with real documentation files, I've identified significant issues with both the chunking strategy and graph extraction that severely limit the system's effectiveness for RAG applications.

## Current Setup

### System Configuration
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI running on port 8642
- **Frontend**: Vite/React on port 5892
- **Chunking Strategy**: Fixed-size chunking (500 characters)
- **Graph Extraction**: Appears to be non-functional

## Issues Identified

### 1. Chunking Strategy Problems

#### A. No Token Counting
- **Issue**: All chunks report 0 tokens despite having token counting code
- **Impact**: Cannot properly manage context windows for LLMs
- **Evidence**: `"tokens": 0` for all chunks despite content

#### B. Hard Character Cutoffs
- **Issue**: Chunks are cut at exactly 500 characters, breaking mid-word and mid-sentence
- **Evidence**: 
  ```
  Chunk ending: "...research to pro"
  Next chunk: "vide a thorough understanding..."
  ```
- **Impact**: Loss of semantic coherence, broken context

#### C. No Overlap Implementation
- **Issue**: Despite having overlap code (chunk_overlap parameter), no actual overlap between chunks
- **Evidence**: Consecutive chunks have no shared content
- **Impact**: Loss of context continuity for retrieval

#### D. Poor Semantic Boundaries
- **Issue**: Chunks break in the middle of:
  - Mathematical formulas: `\( Y^* \) is the d` | `esired output...`
  - Code blocks
  - Sentences
  - Paragraphs
- **Impact**: Retrieved chunks often lack complete information

### 2. Graph Extraction Failures

#### A. No Entity Extraction
- **Issue**: Graph nodes count = 0 for all documents
- **Evidence**: 
  ```json
  {
    "nodes_count": 0,
    "edges_count": 0
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Graph-based retrieval completely non-functional

#### B. No Relationship Extraction
- **Issue**: Empty relationships array for all documents
- **Evidence**: `/api/graph/{doc_id}/relationships` returns `[]`
- **Impact**: Cannot leverage knowledge graph for enhanced retrieval

#### C. Missing API Endpoints
- **Issue**: Several expected endpoints return 404:
  - `/api/graph/entities`
  - `/api/search/vector`
  - `/api/visualization/graph/{doc_id}`
- **Impact**: Core functionality inaccessible

### 3. Implementation Specifics

#### Current Chunking Implementation (base.py)
```python
class StandardChunker(BaseChunker):
    def __init__(self, max_chunk_size: int = 800, chunk_overlap: int = 100):
        # Parameters exist but not properly used
```

Issues:
- Token counting returns 0 (likely tiktoken not installed/configured)
- Overlap logic exists but doesn't work correctly
- Sentence splitting is rudimentary (regex-based)

#### Semantic Chunker (semantic_chunker.py)
```python
def __init__(self, chunk_size: int = 500, chunk_overlap: int = 50):
    # Character-based, not token-based
```

Issues:
- Uses character count instead of tokens
- Overlap implementation is flawed
- No consideration for document structure (headers, lists, etc.)

## Chunk Examples from Real Documents

### Example 1: Context Engineering Guide
- **Document Size**: 13,160 characters
- **Chunks Created**: 27
- **Average Chunk Size**: 487 characters
- **Problems**:
  - Mathematical notation broken: formula split across chunks
  - Technical terms split: "pro" | "vide"
  - No semantic boundaries respected

### Example 2: Manus Lessons Document
- **Document Size**: 15,100 characters
- **Chunks Created**: 31
- **Average Chunk Size**: ~487 characters
- **Problems**: Same issues as above

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Fix Token Counting**
   - Ensure tiktoken is properly installed
   - Implement fallback token estimation
   - Test token counting functionality

2. **Implement Proper Overlap**
   - Fix the overlap logic to actually retain content
   - Use token-based overlap, not character-based
   - Typical recommendation: 10-20% overlap

3. **Respect Semantic Boundaries**
   - Don't break mid-word or mid-sentence
   - Preserve markdown structure (headers, lists, code blocks)
   - Consider using spaCy for better sentence segmentation

4. **Enable Graph Extraction**
   - Debug why entities aren't being extracted
   - Check Claude/SpaCy integration
   - Ensure graph service is properly initialized

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Adaptive Chunking**
   - Use document structure to inform chunk boundaries
   - Respect headers as natural section breaks
   - Keep code blocks intact

2. **Hierarchical Chunking**
   - Create parent-child chunk relationships
   - Enable multi-resolution retrieval

3. **Better Graph Integration**
   - Extract entities and relationships during chunking
   - Link chunks to graph nodes
   - Enable hybrid retrieval (vector + graph)

## Testing Recommendations

To properly evaluate the fixes, implement tests that check:
1. Token counts are non-zero and accurate
2. Overlap exists between consecutive chunks
3. No mid-word breaks
4. Entities are extracted from documents
5. Search endpoints return results
6. Graph visualization shows nodes and edges

## Conclusion

The current implementation has fundamental issues that prevent effective RAG functionality:
- **Chunking**: Breaking semantic units, no working overlap, no token counting
- **Graph**: Completely non-functional entity/relationship extraction
- **Search**: Missing or non-functional endpoints

These issues must be addressed before the system can be used for production RAG applications.
