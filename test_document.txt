RAG Visualizer Test Document

This is a test document for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) visualizer system. The system integrates multiple cloud services including:

1. AWS Bedrock with Claude Sonnet 4 - Used for intelligent entity extraction and natural language understanding
2. OpenAI API - Provides text-embedding-3-small for creating vector embeddings
3. Supabase - PostgreSQL database for storing documents and chunks
4. Qdrant Cloud - Vector database for similarity search
5. Neo4j AuraDB - Graph database for knowledge graph storage
6. AWS Textract - OCR service for PDF and image processing

The architecture follows a modern RAG pipeline:
- Document ingestion and processing
- Intelligent chunking strategies
- Vector embedding generation
- Knowledge graph construction
- Multi-modal retrieval

Key technologies include FastAPI, React, TypeScript, and Python. The system supports hierarchical chunking, semantic search, and graph-based retrieval strategies.

This document tests the entity extraction capabilities and ensures all services are properly integrated.
